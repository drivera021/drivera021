## 🚀 About Me

I’m a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Information Systems Technology from Miami Dade College, where I honed my skills in network administration, cybersecurity, and IT risk assessment. My journey in tech has led me to work as a Helpdesk Engineer at LAN Infotech and complete a cybersecurity internship at Ocean Bank. I’m passionate about expanding my horizons in network administration and cybersecurity, and I'm always eager to tackle new challenges in the tech world.

I love baseball, playing dominoes, and eating food from the Caribbean. I'm super proud of my Puerto Rican-Dominican hertiage and love exploring new cultures and food in my free time. I was raised in a family of musicians, so we were raised to play music and enjoy our musical roots.
